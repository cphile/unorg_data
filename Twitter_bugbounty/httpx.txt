1/6 httpx can be used with a target list or piped with other tools:

$ httpx -list subdomains.txt

$ subfinder -d ups. com | httpx -silent

$ httpx -l subs.txt -ports 8080 -threads 100

2/6 Specific Path or file:

It's possible to request a specific file or path useful for searching misconfiguration on multiple targets:

$ httpx -l subs.txt -silent -path “/.git/” -fr -mc 200

3/6 Match specified values

You can match responses based on various values:

$ httpx -l subs.txt -path "?redir=http://example. com" -match-string 'Example Domain'

$ httpx -l subs.txt -match-code 200

$ httpx -l subs.txt -mcdn azure

4/6 Complete Scan

Here's how you can get all the key information about the target:

$ httpx -l subs.txt -silent -ports 80,443,8008,8080,8443,8843,5000,9001 -title -status-code -server -ip -content-length -tech-detect -asn -cdn -threads 100

5/6 Output format

The best way to store the results is by saving the output in csv or json (in combination with jq):

$ httpx -l subs.txt -csv -o results.csv

$ httpx -l subs.txt -json -o results.json

6/6 Slow down the Scan

httpx is so powerfull but as many other tools it can overload small servers, so try this

$ httpx -l subs.txt -threads 10 -rate-limit 35

$ httpx -l subs.txt -rate-limit-minute 200
